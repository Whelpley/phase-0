Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
-Log in to Github, go to your profile page (click on your picture), click on the "+" on the upper right, select "New Repository" from the menu.  Give it a name, check the settings, and click the green "Create Repository" to finish. To clone to your computer, go to the repository on Github, highlight and copy the URL listed under "HTTPS Clone URL". On your hoe computer, open the terminal application, navigate to the folder you want to clone to, them type the command "git clone ", followed by pasting the URL, then hitting Enter to finish the clone process.

Describe what open source means.
-Open Source is a type of software licensing that allows the code for a program may be viewed by its users, rather than remaining hidden to all but its creators. Various types of licences exist with degrees of permissions and requirements for users, but all allow for the viewing of the code.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
-Open Source seems to be an excellent way to distribute the development of software, and make it accessible to a wide audience. While this is excellent for the spread of knowledge, it presents challenges, such as how to provide compensation for contributors, and how to maintain quality of code over successive versions.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
-Open source licenses are necessary first and foremost to overcome the copyright that inherently exists with works of code (assuming you wish others to see and use it). There are a number of popular existing licenses you may adopt for your code that provide varying degrees of distribution, attribution, and compensation requirements.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
-I got better practice in the process of making commits in git, and the pull request process in Github. Both were accomplished much more smoothly than the last exercise.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
-Not at this time.
