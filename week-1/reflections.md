# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

"Time Boxing" is a technique used by Dr Who and other Time Lords to travel the reaches of spacetime, by means of the TARDIS device, which appears as a British police box on the outside.

Just kidding!

What Time Boxing really about is the technique of declaring a specific, fixed time in which to accomplish a task, working with focus on that task (brooking no distractions), and then stopping at the declared end time.  The Pomodoro Technique is a well-known example, which uses 25-minute work periods, followed by 5-minute breaks. I have already been using it during reading assignments for Phase 0, and plan to try it out during coding as well.

Aside from Time Boxing, I also learned in this reading period about:

-Growth vs Fixed mindsets: addressing the fundamental belief in personal change

-Flow States: how to enter into a state of creativity that comes without inhibition;

-Meditation, and how it can clear the brain to allow flow states

-Willpower, and how to build it using small “bites” of tasks

-Procrastination: what causes people to avoid doing what they need to do

As for that last subject, it has been my personal demon for most of my life. I am a terrible procrastinator; when something has to be done, but I don’t want to do it, I will find myriad ways of occupying my time to avoid that task, until the deadline approaches, adrenaline kicks in, and I Get It Done.

I recognize that this is not a sustainable way to work, and especially inadvisable in an intensive program such as DBC. Waiting until the last minute burns me out, and I generally don’t produce my best work.

To combat this trend, I plan on employing the following means:

-Begin work early on my assignments, and break them up into sub-goals for each day, and for each work period during the day; setting up manageable chunks of work with specific & realistic deadlines.

-Using a timer to enforce specific work periods (a la the Pomodoro), allowing for no other activity (especially anything on the Web) but the task at hand.

-Keeping up my yoga practice, which keeps me calm and collected. Panic serves none.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection


What is a shell? What is "bash?"
In UNIX terminology, a “shell” is a user interface on a computer, consisting of a text-based command input and return. “Bash” is a specific version of the interface that is currently used.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
My primary challenge was enacting the various study habits that I have been reading about in preparation for this course work. This was the first time since preparing for my DBC interview that I have been seriously studying the code itself, and it can be intellectually exhausting. I would frequently be tempted to procrastinate; to counter this I used the Pomodoro technique, interspersing periods of focused work with set breaks.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
For the most part yes, but I do not fully understand the Environment (exercises 21 & 22 in the Command Line Crash Course).

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
Grep – fast searching amongst files to specific strings

Cd, ls, pwd – get your bearings and navigate the system

| , >, < , >> : sending file outputs from place to place

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd: Print working directory – shows where you are now

-ls: Lists What is in current directory

-mv: Moves a file or directory

-cd: Changes currenty directory

-../: Indicates moving up/back a levelin directory tree

-touch: Makes a new, empty file

-mkdir: make a new directory

-less: page through a file; have to press Q to exit

-rmdir: removes a directory (but not is it has contents)

-rm: removes a file (can do directories recursively with the –rf addition)

-help: not for Mac/Unix version, on Windows it finds a manual page for a command (like “man” for Unix)

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection


If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
-To create a new repository, go to your Github user page ( found at github.com/[your user name] ), click on the “+” at the upper right, select “New Repository” from the drop-down. On the next page, give your new repo a title, adjust the setttings as desired, and click the green “Create Repository” button.

-To fork a repo, navigate to the GitHub URL for the repo you are trying to fork. Click the “Fork” button on the upper right, then select your user account from the pop-up. You will then be automatically navigated to the newly-forked repo on your account.

-To clone a repo, navigate to the repo on your GitHub account (not the one you just forked from!). Select and copy the URL from the lower right of the page (listed below the “HTTPS clone URL” text) to your clipboard. Next, open your command-line terminal, and navigate to the folder you want to clone your repo to. Type the command “git clone “, then paste the URL from the clipboard at the end of the line, then hit Enter to clone the repo to the current folder.

-When you fork a repository, you make an instant copy of an repo from another account to your own, which is both easier than creating a new repo and all copying all of the files, and also provides a chain of reference for where your code came from.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
-This exercise was not too much of a struggle, though getting a handle on the new terminology took some work. There was an extra challenge in this reflection phase, in that in order to explain the process succinctly, I had to get a more solid grasp on it first.

-I learned how to use GitHub for the first time, and got a better grasp on explaining a process in the bargain. I also opened Sublime text for the first time, but did not yet spend the time to get a handle on that program.
