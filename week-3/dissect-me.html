<!-- Reflection time!

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

These are the essential ones; so essential Sublime already has that html skeleton snippet from Release 1:
<html> - gotta have it,
<head> - defines the header section, not displayed but contains meta info about the page
<body> - definies the displayed content of the page
<title> - page title, important for browsers (it is what the page saves as a bookmark, and what shows up in a search engine)


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

-I'm not sure if I understand the question, but I think the elements get laid out on the page in the order they appear in the file. There is also a tree structure to HTML, in which elements that are nested inside of other elements will also appear inside of them as well.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

-Sublime has some powerful shortcut capabilities with the snippets. When I get a better idea of what I am repeatedly typing in HTML (or whatever other language this supports), I will first research if a snippet already exists for it (like the very useful HTML skeleton one from Release 1), and then create a new one if needed.
