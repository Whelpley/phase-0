Reflection Time!

What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
-You must have the correct file path linked to the external file.


What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
-To position the link columns, we separated them into 2 sections, tagged each with an ID, then floated each left and right. This left the Geico section floating in the middle, so we ID'd that too and used clear:both in CSS to get it below the columns. This solution took a little while to realize, but was fairly simple to implement.


What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
-We used the following CSS properties:
color
font-weight
font-size
text-align



Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
-Yes, we used ID's to float around the link columns and Geico box, because it was a quick way to do one thing to one element. We used a class to mark the boxes where we added borders (instead of using HTML <hr> tags) because there were two items that needed the same styling, which were not identical enough to pick out using standard selectors.


When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
-It looks like the original BH site uses no CSS whatsoever. I believe the version we created is the hands-down winner in cleanliness and best practices, because it is much easier to read and alter when the stying is separated from the HTML content.
