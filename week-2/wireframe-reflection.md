What is a wireframe?
-A wireframe is a preliminary stage of the web design process, in which a stripped-down version of a site's pages are drawn as simple shapes and forms. While details such as color and sharing are excluded, spatial layout is addressed at this stage.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
-The wireframe allows the details of spatial layout and of a web page to be perfected before moving on to details like color and content. Seeing the skeletal form away from other visual distractions enables designers to give a site a more pleasing and useful flow.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
-Actually, I did not. In the time I allowed myself for this task, I could not get a grasp on how to make an attractive wireframe, and had to mock up something quick and ugly. I still feel like I have a poor understanding of how to create a good wireframe, and will return to this subject later.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
-I stuck with the first idea, not because I was happy with it, but that I recognized that I could spend too much time trying to figure this out.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
-The big question here for me was deciding which wireframe tool to start using to make mine; there was a glut of options presented in the blog, but many were not free, and my time to evaluate them was limited. I went with Gliffy to draw my wireframes, and was easily able to use it to make a basic one, but I am still confused about the deeper aspects of the process.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
-While I enjoyed learning about this stage of the web design process, and am excited to learn more, I found the actual design process unpleasant, largely because of my inexperience with constructing a web page (just not knowing where to put things), and inexperience with choosing and using a wireframe design tool.
-I also experienced a challenge in the pull request process in GitHub. I think it originated when I made 2 commits in a row, without pushing to GitHub, but right now I'm not sure. Either way, GitHub now tells me that "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved". I am now attempting to save the work (updated with this entry) in a new branch on git, then beginning the process again.
