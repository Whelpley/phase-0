<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I feel like I am now master of the internet. Really though, it is empowering to begin understanding the basic structure of web pages, and to put that knowledge into use.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fairly straightforward; I found a good site that let me look up the tags and how they worked: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
For the most part, it was a relief to not have to include formatting. We did use the <center> tag though, mostly because it seemed simple to implement; I am not sure if that counts as "formatting".

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
On the positive side, it feels very straightforward - in essence, just wrap your text with whatever tabs you wish to apply. On the negative, it looks like a sharp eye is required to ensure the closing of tags; proper tab-spacing of your code seems to be a good way to keep track of them.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
1) Close your tags! (except when they self-close)
2) Tab-indent sections for clarity
