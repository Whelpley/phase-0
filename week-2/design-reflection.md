What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
1) Information Gathering - who is this site for, and what do you want them to do with it?
2) Planning - development of the site map, determination of which additional elements/tools to incorporate
3) Design - determine look & feel, aesthetic decisions
4) Development - creating the site on the code level
5) Testing and Delivery - make sure it works (test on multiple browsers) and upload it for live use
6) Maintenance - updating content, debugging

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
-My site's primary purpose will be to attract potential employers to hire me. As such, it will include links to my blog, my professionally relevant projects, a contact information, a short biography, and links to other sites I find interesting.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
-My target audience is interested in finding bright new minds to recruit for their endeavor, people who both have technical skills and can work in teams. I will demonstrate my technical capabilities through my blog entries and code projects, and hope that my human side comes through in manner and style of how I write. A well chosen desgin will also be important for demonstrating my aesthetic taste.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site?
Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio?
It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
-Mainly, I wish them to go to the blog page and portfolio, and then be able to contact me.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
-First off, design matters: people want to use aesthetically pleasing sites, and will stop using difficult and ugly ones. Secondly, planning matters: a unified, consistent design chosen at the beginning of the project will save hassle down the line.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
-User experience design (also called UX) is the art of optimizing web sites to enhance the user-end experience. It incorporates visual aesthetics and the psychology of storytelling to increase the pleasure and usability of a web site. It is valuable whenever you want to create a site that people with return to and keep using (that is to say, most of the time).

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
-I found it difficult to find a free site map creating tool that would let me export an image, so I wrote my map on paper, took a photo on my phone, and sent it to myself.
-I also found the process of including an image here to be difficult.
